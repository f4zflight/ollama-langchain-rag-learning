This project integrates Ollama, LangChain, and RAG for LLM-based applications.

# Ollama LangChain RAG Learning Project

This repository contains the code and resources for learning and experimenting with **Ollama**, **LangChain**, and **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**. The project aims to provide hands-on experience in building and deploying applications with these powerful technologies.

## Project Overview

In this project, we integrate Ollama (a large language model) with LangChain, a framework for building LLM-powered applications, and apply Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance the capabilities of language models. This approach enables more efficient querying and better performance in handling complex tasks that require external knowledge.

## Development Environment

The project was developed on **Windows 11** using the following tools:

- **Visual Studio Code** (VSCode) for code editing and debugging
- **Python** (specific version: Python 3.x)
- **Poetry** for dependency management and virtual environments (Poetry (version 2.1.1))
- **Ollama** for language model integration (ollama version is 0.6.2)
- **LangChain** for building LLM-powered applications
- **RAG** for improved context retrieval in LLM tasks

### Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/f4zflight/ollama-langchain-rag-learning.git
   cd ollama-langchain-rag-learning

2. Install dependencies using Poetry:

First, ensure you have Poetry installed. You can install it by following the instructions at Poetry's official website.

Then, install the project dependencies:

bash
poetry install

3. Activate the virtual environment:
bash
poetry shell

4. Run the application:
bash
python main.py

Features
Ollama Integration: Use Ollama's advanced language model to generate text-based outputs and answers.
LangChain Framework: Build complex, chainable language model pipelines with LangChain.
RAG Implementation: Enhance LLMs with external knowledge retrieval to improve response quality and accuracy.
